    <p>This maze was generated by creating a grid of cells. A random starting cell is picked. After calculating that cell's neighbors
      we then randomly pick and move to that neighbor and remove the wall between the two. If the neighbor has been visited before,
    it's removed from the list. </p>

    <h2>A little about A*</h2>
    <p>A* is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm</p>
    <p>The algorithm works by measuring 3 values:

      <ul>
      <li><b>f</b> is the sum of g and h</li>
      <li><b>g</b> is the movement "cost" from the starting point to a given square on the grid</li>
      <li><b>h</b> is the estimated movement cost to move from that given square (f) to the final destination.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>h</b> is derived with a <b>heuristic</b> method. This algorithm is using the euclidean distance to get the absolute
    path from the start to the end. It then compares the cost of moving to the absolute distance from that cell. It always attempts
    to get a cost as low as possible, knowing that the lowest possible cost is the absolute path.
